### Hugo 'klafyvel' Levy-Falk ðŸ‘‹

Hi there, I am a Physics PhD student who wanders on the computer side of the force in his free time.

I have a [personal page](https://klafyvel.me/) if you want to see the kind of stuff I do, such as blog posts or academic publications and not only the code I've written and put on GitHub.

But because we all love summary statistics (whatever they might mean), here are some nice-looking statistics cards :sparkles:

And for my friends, here is a proof that I am not doing _too much_ Julia.
